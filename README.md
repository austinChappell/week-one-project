## Description

This is a project from The Iron Yard demonstrating knowledge of basic HTML and CSS. Every nav bar is essentially identical, except the 'active' class changes depending on which page is currently loaded.

### Thing to know

This project primarily uses flex-box to achieve its layout, but floats are used on occasion as well.

The images on the main page have a hover effect. As the cursor hovers an image, the image zooms in by 10%, fades to gray, and a text overlay fades in at a slower transition than the zoom and grayscale. Clicking the images will not redirect you anywhere, as this is a demo.

The About page contains a relative anchor tag, so clicking on the first link redirects to another part of the page. The background image halfway down the page has a fixed background, creating a bit of a 3-D effect. Every odd table row contains a beige background color.

The newsletter page is simply a signup form, with a background image that takes up the entire screen, with a min-height of 100vh. Flex-box was used to center the form vertically on the page.
